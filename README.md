# Mass-Issue-Closer
Mass-Github-Issue-Closer due to the fact I created too many issues.

This python script will close all issues in a specific github repo in order to use the script generate a classic GitHub PAT with the full repo and full public_repo scope.

Next update the name and repository with your username and the repository you want to update. Then let the magic happen.
